# CIND-820: Big Data Analytics Project

This repository hosts my work related to the CIND-820: Big Data Analytics Project.

The objective is to determine whether the cost of an urban development project in the City of Vancouver can be accurately predicted through various geospatial data points that may not necessarily have linear impacts on a development projects cost.

All of the data for this project was obtained from the [Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/?disjunctive.features&disjunctive.theme&disjunctive.keyword&disjunctive.data-owner&disjunctive.data-team&sort=modified) and is consumed through the use of a public [API](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/console).

Part 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation

Part 2: Working With Other Geospatial Data Sets

Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

A comprehensive breakdown of all the steps performed can be found in the complete [notebook](https://github.com/RoryAJames/CIND-820/blob/ed8690e7bc34b19a9564bd5b78fcd00e57ef7e71/CIND.ipynb).
